In this chapter we will explain the extent of our results, and how it is possible to extract a binary landcover map with the presence and ausence of water.

\section{Model creation}

In order to create the model we need to select a sample from the thumbnails that we extracted from the original images. We wanted to create a process that was easily reproductible so we would compare models in a simple fashion. To this end the sample must be random each run and we need to split the images in three sets: training, validation and testing.
