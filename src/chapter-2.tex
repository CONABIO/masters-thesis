In this chapter we talk about the state of the art in computer vision and how it has been used for remote sensing problems. We also give a brief account of natural disaster assesment, and how are these machine techniques applied in this sense. We use Sandy Huricane as a study case because of the data that was publicly made available by the NOAA.

In late years the groundbreaking advances in computer vision have had a tremendous impact in other science fields. In particular, we are interested in landcover classification.
