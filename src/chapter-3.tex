In this chapter the mathematical details of the CNN are exposed. How does backpropagation works, and differences between multiclass and multilabel classificati√≥n.

\section{Tensorflow}

Tensorflow is a framework developed by the Google Brain Team, and opened sourced in November 9, 2015 \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}. It was developed with the focus of having an easy to use system. It was thought as a way to expressing Machine Learning algorithms using a common interface. In this section we will untangle some of the details of how tensorflow and its graph model work \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/AbadiBCCDDDGIIK16}.
