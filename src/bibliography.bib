An initial task was to retrieve the history of earthquakes in Mexico in order throughout to produce an exhaustive inventory. The main result was a paradigmatic catalogue, published some
years ago as the book Los sismos en la historia de México (Earthquakes in Mexican History). It contains information about every event along 450 years of Mexican seismological history. This paper will focus on the background of this seismological compilation and its characteristics, addressing mainly methodological items concerning sources, qualitative and/or quantitative data, the importance of joint and multidisciplinary efforts, and the research they have inspired on historical earthquakes investigation in Mexico.},

The research is based on historical sources and previous investigations already published for two of the seismic events (8 March 1800 and 19 June 1858), with newly retrieved and analysed data for the 7 April 1845 earthquake. Primary and secondary sources include reports on damage to city buildings,
streets and neighbourhoods and allowed a detailed analysis of the national and local effects, impacts and responses to each of the three earthquakes, whose comparison allows a better understanding of specific aspects related to the investigation of historical earthquakes in Mexico.},

ABSTRACT = {Estimating forest area at a national scale within the United Nations program of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) is primarily based on land cover information using remote sensing technologies. Timely delivery for a country of a size like Mexico can only be achieved in a standardized and cost-effective manner by automatic image classification. This paper describes the operational land cover monitoring system for Mexico. It utilizes national-scale cartographic reference data, all available Landsat satellite imagery, and field inventory data for validation. Seven annual national land cover maps between 1993 and 2008 were produced. The classification scheme defined 9 and 12 classes at two hierarchical levels. Overall accuracies achieved were up to 76%. Tropical and temperate forest was classified with accuracy up to 78% and 82%, respectively. Although specifically designed for the needs of Mexico, the general process is suitable for other participating countries in the REDD+ program to comply with guidelines on standardization and transparency of methods and to assure comparability. However, reporting of change is ill-advised based on the annual land cover products and a combination of annual land cover and change detection algorithms is suggested.},

    abstract = {Could social media data aid in disaster response and damage assessment? Countries face both an increasing frequency and an increasing intensity of natural disasters resulting from climate change. During such events, citizens turn to social media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social media improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information, enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. In addition, the spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with the real-time monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. We present a multiscale analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We examine the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the United States and find a strong relationship between proximity to Sandy{\textquoteright}s path and hurricane-related social media activity. We show that real and perceived threats, together with physical disaster effects, are directly observable through the intensity and composition of Twitter{\textquoteright}s message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly correlates with the per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. We verify our findings for a wide range of disasters and suggest that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.},
